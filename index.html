            </div>
            <div class="timeline-body">
              <p>TWhen the ½ Anna was printed the process necessitated that the “BAHRAIN” and “ANNA” was printed first where after the decimal “½” was added in a subsequent operation. This is why the first print of the ½ Anna can sometimes be recognized by the “½” was being placed centrally above the “ANNA”.

            This technique produced the most unusual error in the form of the “missing ½”. Donaldson writes that a number of sheets missed out on the second operation with one of these sheets being discovered in the Muharraq Post Office after half the sheet had been sold. The remaining half of the sheet was subsequently withdrawn and returned to the G.P.O. However, two more sheets were discovered making the number of possible existing examples of the error 600 (2 sheets of 240 plus half a sheet). A considerable of stamps were philatelically used on covers, which were addressed locally. The most common philatelic use is on covers cancelled at the Muharraq Post Office on November 20th and 21st 1953 with the Muharraq canceller – Donaldson type 23.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="timeline-body">
              <p>Bahrain issued its first independent stamp on the 15th of March 1953 bearing a portrait of the then ruler, Sheikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa. The value of the stamp was 1 ½ Anna, which was the internal letter rate at the time. The stamp was the first of a set of three and the other two values - ½ Anna and 1 Anna - were issued in October 1956.

            By the time of the issue the Bahrain State Postal Service had taken over the internal mail system and as such was the recipient of all revenues generated by the use of the local stamps. This was seen as a first move towards postal independence.

            Donaldson writes that though the stamps were intended for local use the stamps were occasionally used on international mail for which they were equally accepted. The stamps are typically found with British Agency cancellations, but the State Post Office had introduced locally made cancellers in order to cancel only local mail. A total of 3 cancellers were introduced and the first of the 3 was the first to incorporate “Bahrain” in Arabic. The next two were the first area specific cancellers to be introduced in Bahrain both issued for the “Manama” post-office and as for the local “Bahrain” canceller the two “Manama” cancellers included Manama in Arabic.</p>
